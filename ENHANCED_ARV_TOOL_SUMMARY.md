### Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
const calculateRegimenScore = (regimen) => {
  let score = 5.0; // Base score
  
  // Clinical parameter adjustments
  if (viralLoad === 'suppressed_6m') score += 1.0;
  if (cd4Count === 'le_50') score -= 1.0;
  if (comorbidities.includes('renal')) score -= 0.3;
  
  // First-line regimen bonus
  if (firstLineRegimens.includes(regimen)) score += 1.0;
  
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(10, score));
};
```
